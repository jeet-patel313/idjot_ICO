# IdjotICO : An Ethereum-based Crowdfunding Platform

- This code defines a smart contract for an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) <br>
  of a token named "IdjotICO" with the symbol "WIN". The contract is written <br>
  in the Solidity programming language and is compatible with the <br>
  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The contract implements the ERC20 token standard, <br>
  which is a widely-used standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum network. <br>

- The contract allows users to invest in the ICO by sending Ether to the contract. <br>
  The investment amount must be between 0.05 and 5 Ether.

- The ICO has a hard cap of 8.22 million Ether, beyond which no more investments will be accepted. <br> The ICO has a time limit of one week from the start of the sale.

- The contract keeps track of the amount of Ether raised and the number of tokens distributed <br>
  to each investor. The contract also has several functions for controlling the state of the ICO,<br> such as starting, halting, or resuming the ICO, and changing the deposit address <br> where the invested Ether is stored. The contract also has a mechanism for returning the <br> invested Ether to the investors in case the ICO fails.
